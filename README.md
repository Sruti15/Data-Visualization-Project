**INTRODUCTION**
  Crime is an activity that happens around the world each and every day whether you know it or not. For example, the U.S. crime rate per 100,000 people for aggravated assault was 250.2 whereas for larceny/theft it was about 1,550 (Pew Research Center) People tend to disregard crime as something that occurs unless they are directly affected by it. Our team hopes to increase crime awareness at least in the United States through the answering of a few key questions. These questions are as follows:
  What are the differences and similarities in crime trends between different cities?
  Are some cities better at handling different types of crime?
  How has crime affected peopleâ€™s lives?
  What is the profile of crime victims?
  What time of the day is a crime more likely to occur?
  
**DATA SOURCES**

  In order to answer the questions in the introduction, we collected crime data from various sources. We have used the crime data for Los Angeles, California from 2010 to 2019. This dataset was obtained from data.gov. It has 1048576 items and features like Date the crime is reported, Area of crime, Crime type, Crime status, Longitude and latitude of location etc.
