# Data-Visualization-Project


**PROJECT NAME : CRIME ANALYSIS**

  The main aim of the project was to analyze various crime data in the hopes of finding key insights or trends that can potentially increase awareness about crime levels to many different groups of people. This is part of the data visualization project where we have used the crime data and found various data visualizations on the usecases to provide the people with better understanding and insights of the crime reports.

**INTRODUCTION**

  Crime is an activity that happens around the world each and every day whether you know it or not. For example, the U.S. crime rate per 100,000 people for aggravated assault was 250.2 whereas for larceny/theft it was about 1,550 (Pew Research Center) People tend to disregard crime as something that occurs unless they are directly affected by it. Our team hopes to increase crime awareness at least in the United States through the answering of a few key questions. These questions are as follows:
  
  What are the differences and similarities in crime trends between different cities?
  
  Are some cities better at handling different types of crime?
  
  How has crime affected peopleâ€™s lives?
  
  What is the profile of crime victims?
  
  What time of the day is a crime more likely to occur?
  
**DATA SOURCES**

  In order to answer the questions in the introduction, we collected crime data from various sources. We have used the crime data for Los Angeles, California from 2010 to 2019. This dataset was obtained from data.gov. It has 1048576 items and features like Date the crime is reported, Area of crime, Crime type, Crime status, Longitude and latitude of location etc.

**USE CASES**

Below is a list of use cases for the crime data project can be directly applied to.

  1.The Report of time of the day along with the type of the crime when the rate is high.
  
  2.To determine the periods or events of the year during which the crime is high.
  
  3.Profile of the victims that are targeted for specific areas for specific types of crime.
  
  4.Correlation of the victim profile, type of crime, location and time of the crime.
  
  5.Commonly used weapons specific to crime.
  
  6.The locations which have become crime prone recently.
